## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: What is the phone number dialed in sample3.py?

Answer: 5055034455

Question 2: Describe your algorithm. Explain what each of these functions do: get_peak_frqs(), get_max_frq(), and get_number_from_frq().

Answer: The function get_max_frq() returns the frequency with the highest amplitude in the fft array. The function get_number_from_frq() takes the lower and higher frequency and returns the number that matches the pair of frequencies. The function get_peak_frqs() splits the frq and fft arrays in two and invokes the get_max_frq() to find the lower and higher frequency.
